A brief explanation of architecture and components used in Application.

1. I have used MVVM with clean Architecture to develop the ToDoList Application and created separate
 reusable modules for Data and Domain layers.
2. Used Android JetPack Component like Compose, Navigation, Dagger Hilt, Flow and Room database.
3. Used Coroutines to handle the Network task to execute asynchronously. which we boost the performance of the application.
4. Created the Unit and Instrumental test cases for View model and Room Database.
